Welcome to the blog. This blog will house my adventures through grad school and beyond. The contents of this blog will therefore (presumably) be about Data Science and Machine Learning, though it is very much possible that I might add in some other random stuff.

Given how busy grad school is, there is a good chance that this blog will not be periodically updated, but rather, will be sporadically updated. Hence the title. Even so, these sporadic updates should be good™.

The first actual blog post will come sometime next week. See you then.
